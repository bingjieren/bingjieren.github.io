			<p class="overview-content">The public bicycle system which functioned as a part of urban transportation can have a big impact on people’s life. In addition, riding bicycle is a kind of economic and environment-friendly exercise that all citizen can participate in. If we can improve the user experience so as to get the best out of the public bicycle system, it is good for the city’s environment and residents’ health. </br>
			Take my hometown Jinhua as an example, the public bicycle system has been established since 2013. Even the relevant departments have increased the number of bikes and sites constantly, some experience issues  still exist. This project, based on a course assignment, provides interaction design of internet operation system for different devices to make operation process of online and offline smoother. Of course, this design is just a conceptual design which still needs to be evaluated its effectiveness and feasibility.</p>

		<p class="mutiline-dscr">The public bicycle system is included in urban construction plan since 2012 and formally established in 2013. </p>
		<p class="mutiline-dscr">As by November 2014, the data showed that there were nearly 425 sites and more than 8,000 bicycles  put into use. The total number of applying cards was more than 59,000, and the maximum daily use reached 2.39 million. To benefit more residents, the relevant departments are still planning to increase the number of bikes and sites.</p>

	<div class="bg bg2">
		<p class="ct">Meaning of Design</p>
		<p class="mutiline-dscr">The public bicycle system which functioned as a part of urban transportation can have a big impact on people’s life. In some small city, for the reason that the total area is not large and the transport network is not complicated, riding is a good choice. Compare with vehicles, riding is more flexible and convenient, and is applicable to more people because bike requires less technique to master. In addition, people not only use bike as an economic and environment-friendly transportation means but also regard ride as a kind of exercise.</p>
		<p class="dscr">As we observed, since the increasing usage of the public bike, “tidal phenomena”, that is all the parking piles in one site are all empty or full in a short period of time, becomes apparent. There are also some other problems, for example, the card of public bike departs from the bus card and it is easy to be lost, still influence people’s experience. These issues are also mentioned in the user interviews.</p>

		<p class="mutiline-dscr">By creating stakeholder map, we can see all the stakeholders and their possible scenarios when we concentrate on the specific issues and analyze constraints and bottlenecks. </p>
		<p class="mutiline-dscr">Obviously, we should get more insights in the most important stakeholder, that is, cyclist’s behavioral and psychological features when we design the public bicycle system. But, the department and manufacturer should also be taken into account because they are closely related to the transportation network and the quality of the bikes. </p>

<!--last frame-小结-->
	<div class="bg bg1">
		<p class="ct">Conclusion</p>
		<p class="mutiline-dscr">The idea of this project comes from a course assignment. Since the public bike is also a part of our daily life, I supplement some research data and operation system for other device to this project. After all, it is just a conceptual design that has not been evaluated rigorously.</p>
		<p class="mutiline-dscr">The assignment was completed in 2015, supplemented in early 2016 and eventually presented on my portfolio site in 2017. Happily, in the past two years, Jinhua’s public bicycle system has changed tremendously, and many points given in this project have already come true.</p>

		</div>
		<p class="mutiline-dscr">At present, the two apps showed above have been widely used in Jinhua.</p>
		<p class="bottom-dscr">According to the current development trend, the public bicycle system will become more close to citizen’s life in the future.</p>
